### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tanino and I am a Data Scientist with passion for **automation** and **education**.

I recognize the importance of data and data-driven decision, and I enjoy developing tools to promote data-driven decision-making and give access to it to a broader public, though the use of simple **data analysis and visualization widgets***.
This profile collect some of the projects I have build while training my programming skills.
